# Fake multitask os

Develop a program that simulates the operation of multitasking operating systems according to the scenario: let the system input receive a package of N tasks to complete. Each of the tasks is performed sequentially on 3 separate devices: the CPU, hard disk,and network. In other words, the entered data is calculated first, then saved to the hard disk, and then transmitted over the network to the server. Processing by the Central processor takes k±l sec. Writing to the hard disk takes m±v sec. Transmission of results over the network takes b±d sec.
The program must clearly represent the state of the tasks being performed and the resources represented in the system.
